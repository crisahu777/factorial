## Introduction to Factorials

Factorial is a mathematical operation that multiplies a number by every positive integer below it. It is denoted by the exclamation mark (!). For example, the factorial of 5 is calculated as 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

Factorials are commonly used in various mathematical calculations, permutations, and algorithms. Understanding factorials can open up a world of possibilities in the field of mathematics and computer science.
